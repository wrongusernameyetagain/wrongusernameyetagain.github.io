## There's no apocalypse like the Korean Apocalypse

I don't remember for sure how much more did we developped our game, IPO (no, there was no initial public offering). I recall I fell out of touch with Hookdump over something petty, and I felt like my attempt at making a game had gone nowhere.
But had it really?
For one, I had learned a little something about coding, and a lot more about project management. And, most important for this next chapter in my life, I had discovered many other online RPGs.

One of those games had these lil fellas:

I'm talking about Ragnarok Online.
The game that insisted on using 2d sprites on a 3d world, with vector calculation to determine in which of the 45 degrees slices your character was being "looked at" and load that sprite.

The game fascinated me. It had some years of success before even World of Warcraft showed up, and it danced to a tune that few could hear.

As it was the case for Argentum Online, the main menu music of Ragnarok gave me chills.
This wasn't a grand adventure you'd be embarquing on. No.

Here mysterious forces, faerie-like in appearance, would dance and invite you to join them. A slightly sad yet entirely captivating melody lured you further in.

In an almost socialist declaration of principles, all players started in the same way. There was only one class, novice.
You would choose what to specialize in and "grow into" as a job later on, following a simple evolution path.

For example: a bard was an advanced class you only could apply if you had at least 40 "job levels" in the archer base job.

Your actual level and your job level were separated. Equipment was determined by groups of "belonging", so some classes shared different pools of gear.

I could ramble about the intrincacies of RO for hours, even if I haven't played it in over a decade, but that's not what I want to focus on.

I still had creative energy in me, so it didn't take too long after joining one of the many pirate servers that made the game so popular that I dedicated myself to create stories, event suggestions, and even questions on **quests.**

RO included large story-lines, acting as quests, while providing the user almost no indication that quests did in fact exists. You just had to pay attention. Both the quests, the monsters and the maps would be expanded on in bi-yearly content updates, that would eventually get pirated and distributed online. Some times, entire segments of scripts were in Korean. 

I began offering to help with quest testing and patch implementation, and was eventually given a moderator position in that gaming community. That was a lot of imaginary power for a 14 to 15 year old kid.

Ragnarok allowed users to group under "guilds", and participate in player vs player wars at given intervals, in order to control large castles in different cities. 
The longer a guild controlled a castle, the more unique treasures they'd be able to get from the reserves. So these "guild wars" were a big thing in any server. You'd easily get 200 to 300 people fighting to [defend/attack] a given castle, in a set of weird free-for-alls and precarious alliances. 

One guild in particular struck me as more interesting than the rest. A small group of players, all of them extremely talented in playing one or two classes, would offer their services as mercenaries. Their guild-leader, a guy nicknamed Bull, wasn't above negotiating actual money in these contracts.

I got approached and joined them playing first as a tank/distraction of sorts, giving the most sneaky members a chance to infiltrate further into the castle without being detected.

Later on I would try the class that defined the rest of my gaming years. The bard.

Bards in the game had several support skills, in the way of songs that affected a small 3x3 area around them. They had almost no offensive skills, but could inflict certain statuses on enemies, like freezing anyone within screen-range using bad jokes.
The "frost joke" skill would iterate at random from a list in the client folder and each "cast" would have the character say one lame pun. 

I remember the first guild war I joined after editing that file, so all my jokes were targetted at specific players calling them out (or pretending I was someone else giving their guild contrary commands). The chaos that this brought brought a tear to my eye and a warm, fuzzy feeling deep inside of me.

I continued to learn to script basic things, but most importantly, I started to hang in real life with this rather strange group of people.
